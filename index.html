            <p>
      		My name is Lin. Currently, I am a undergraduate student in New Jersey Institute of Technology. 
		    <br>
                <br>
		While in high school, I used to be a tech-support in a construction company with my knowlege of hardware and softwere learned from experience, and there is the first place I applied my knowlege on.
		    Even I do not understand any programing knowlege at those time since I never found a way to get in this field, I always interested in. When entered the college, I have first chance learning coding, and then, I found myself that I love it.
                 Then, With many years of using computer and interested in the mystery behind every computer, I made decision to my path to computer science...
		    <br> <br>
                Outside the life coding, I like reading and drawing at my spare time, and beside that I also really enjoy the Movie and Anime.
            </p>

				<p>"How those 3D character on 3D environment in those video game were been created?"
				<br>
				<br>This question take me to learn 3D modeling since my first year as college student when I knew the software blender from my professor.
				<br>
				<br>
				As picture was shown, it is an island and this is the best project I ever made, which took me an whole day to finish.
				and took a nice snapshot. But, unfortunally all my files was losted when the hard drive of my old desktop was broken.
				While all file was losted, this picture is only one left, which was send to my friend right after I done. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Check for &nbsp<span><a href="works.html">more</a></span></p>

				<div class="page-header"><h1>Games</h1></div>
				<p>
				I am a gamer. I like video games. With the knowleges of 3D modeling, and computer programing, I decide to try some game development.
				Before I get start, I draw myself some excuses, "This will help me to practice coding" and "This is an application of 3D-modeling."
				Believe me, these good excuses. What? You don't agree with me? Don't worry, I agree with you.
				<br>
				<br>
				But wait! Why I need excueses...
				<br>
				<br>
				The original file of game show on right was gone, yet, together with my "Island" project.

				<p>I formally start to learn web-development by myself during the summer break of 2016.
				<br>
				<br> 
				"Having some web-developing sktll extremely helpful", which was been told by my professor, then I start and try.
				But soon I found that, building a good site is always time consumming and challenge to do....
				<br>
				<br>
				Therefore, while and after learning, I only make a simple page for practive purpose, which was shown on the left. 
				And you are aleady browsing my second site. </p>

			<p>"What is 'photoshop'?"
			<br>
			<br>
			When I a teen, I always heard some people criticize, "This photo is fake! It's photoshop!"
			I heard "photoshop" since very young, but for long of period time, I never have an idea about what it mean.
			<br>
			<br>
			Now, I almost need it on my every project, the one shown on the right was one I make for this webpage.

			<p>This is one of my hobby.
			<br>
			<br>
			I like drawing since when I was a little kid. Honestly, I used to think to be an artist.
			And of course, it will never achieve.
